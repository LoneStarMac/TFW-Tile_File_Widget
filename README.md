# TFW: Tile File Widget

A dynamic web tool for creating and customizing tiled background patterns. Originally designed for Team Family Wiess, this widget allows you to tile images seamlessly with interactive controls for real-time customization. Test to make sure your backgrounds as perfectly coordinated as a statue-turning jack.

## Default Pattern

The widget comes with a built-in "TFW" pattern featuring:
- Goldenrod background (#ffcc00) - as bright as the goldfish chairs in commons
- Black geometric elements and rotated text
- Endless tiling design (like the student center project!)
- Easy color customization

## Customization

### Editing the Default Pattern
The SVG pattern is embedded directly in the HTML for easy editing. Look for the `data:image/svg+xml` section in the CSS to modify:
- Colors (change `%23ffcc00` hex values)
- Text content (modify the "TFW" text)
- Geometric shapes (adjust path elements)

### Using Your Own Images
1. Click "Choose File" in the control panel
2. Select any image file (PNG, JPG, GIF, etc.)
3. The widget automatically extracts colors and updates the interface
4. Use the tile size slider to adjust pattern scale
5. Hit reset if things get start feeling like Dis-O

## Browser Support

Works in your acabrowser of choice:
- âœ… Chrome/Chromium 60+ (the speed Brown College students go the wrong way on loop road)
- âœ… Firefox 55+ (like admin on VSIP)
- âœ… Safari 12+ (those first-year students keep getting younger, right? we're still young?)
- âœ… Edge 79+ (like your prof with the scantrons)

## Technical Details

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - no frameworks or libraries
- **Responsive design** - if it runs doom, it runs this
- **Canvas-based color extraction** - smart image analysis for UI theming
- **Dynamic CSS injection** - real-time slider styling updates
